This is the source code of my personal blog you can find under
[https://davidraab.github.io](https://davidraab.github.io)
It is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

To run this code you need **Hugo extended**, not the normal version.
The theme contains SCSS/SASS and this is not included in the normal
version.

run: `hugo server` to create a local webserver for the site.
run: `hugo` to create the static site in the `public/` folder.
