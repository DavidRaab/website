It is about language design. The problem of specific syntax in languages
leads to the fact that you want more and more specific syntax. Or you
nearly always want ways to define or override extsing syntax.

This leads to languages that always implement new stuff through new language
syntax, making the language more and more complex.

A solution to this would be a language that defines no special syntax for
anything. Like LISP usually does.

It shows that people usually like more complex languages instead of simple
ones.

Perl example: Newer Hash dereference.
