Some Perl optimization.

* defining variables outside of loop.
* defining subroutine outside of loop.
* using state (also consider problem when using subs)
* comparing integers vs string
* regex: not using captures when not needed.
* regex: possesive quantifiers
* avoiding function calls (inlining)
* hash vs binary saerch
* general using hashes vs. array
* Plain Array/Hash vs classes
* string-eval for code optimization
* picking good algorithm.
* avoiding type-checking (at runtime/release app)
* foreach loop vs. old-school for-loop with index based access
* map/grep vs building array with foreach loop
* Using Profiler (Hint: Advent of Code Array2D)
* Caching? (Memoization Fibonacci)
