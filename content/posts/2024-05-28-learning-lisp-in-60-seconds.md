Do you wanna learn Lisp? If yes, you come to the right place. Do you
know how to call a function/procedure in most languages? Yes right, like
this.

```js
function(arg1, arg2, arg3)
```

This syntax is used in C, C++, Perl, Python, Java, ... you get it.

In a Lisp language you just put the starting `(` before the function call
and remove the commas.

```racket
(function arg1 arg2 arg3)
```

There you have it, you have learned 100% of the syntax of a Lisp language.
The remaining part is just learning some functions. Have fun!

# Further Reading

I recommend [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) for learning. Why?

1. You download just a package and it contains everything. An IDE with REPL
   and you can immediately start coding.
2. It has a lot of [good documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/).

Maybe you wanna start with [The introduction with Pictures](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html)
I think it is a good start also for learning functional concepts. Just start
reading it and maybe you wanna try it out.

You also should read [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)
by Peter Norvig if you didn't do it yet.
